# Autonomus-Car

This project aims to implement a self-driving Car that can avoid the <br/>
obstacles with very fast response:<br/>
❑    Ultrasonic is placed on servo motor axis, its function to detect <br/>
the obstacles on the car way.<br/>
❑    If the car found an obstacle, it must change its way according <br/>
to the ultrasonic data.<br/>

# Cmoponents you will need:<br/>

1-Ultrasonic HC- SR04.<br/>
2-Servo motor.<br/>
3-two L293D.<br/>
4-4WD RC Car.<br/>
